# Timecop

## Background

This project was assigned to me and my classmate during our work practice at Effectosft, which was arranged through our IT-Gymnasieingengörs Schooling at Kattegattgymnasiet.

## Purpose

Timecop is a project similar to Toggle and Clockify. It is meant to track the time spent on individual issues (programming tasks) connected to Effectsofts' Atlassian, Jira, and Tempo service environments, through the services' APIs.

The project is built in C# .NET Blazer, a C# web application framework. This was later incorporated into the at-the-time beta-version of C# MAUI; which makes the blazor project into an all-platform native (including iOS and Andriod) application as well as a web application.

Our task by Effectsoft was to create an mvp *(minimal viable product)* during our four weeks of work practice. Some of the points included were:

- List available Jira issues
- Submit and update issues with information including time spent, what's been done etc.
- User API logins for access to users' projects and therethrough issues.

## Development

Me and my collaborator pair-programmed together during this project. Neither of us had any knowledge of Blazor nor MAUI before the launch of this task.

We learned and developed this application over four weeks.

We got access to Effectsofts test environments during this project, with access to Atlassian, Jira, and Tempo.

This project was version-manged with git and stored on BitBucket.

We got basic pre-developed API and convertion -code (out-dated) and soruces of API documentation.
